# YellCube
This device is intended to connect stream audio and flash lights representative of the audio. This device streams songs that are uploaded to another repo (https://github.com/aahnguye101024/ESP32Audio). This project was also a way for me to test out the 3D printer I just bought in a fun way. With an ESP32 pico d4 with an antenna, onboard leds, a dedicated SK6812 LED board, an audio amplifier, an onboard lipo with supported charging and uploading straight to the pico D4, this board can be easily programmed and adapted to any of your speaker and lights project needs.
